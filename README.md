# 📈 SaaS Revenue & Retention Strategy – Document360 Case Study

## 🎯 Overview
A deep-dive analysis of Document360's SaaS growth performance using core SaaS metrics, product analytics, and business strategy frameworks. Built as part of a data/business analyst assessment for Kovai.co.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Analyze growth challenges across acquisition, retention, and expansion. Identify inefficiencies and propose strategic initiatives to unlock revenue and LTV growth.

## 📊 Key Metrics (Sample Data Provided)
- Website Traffic: 2.5M
- MRR: $1.2M | ARR: $14.4M
- NRR: 98% | Churn: 4.5%/month
- Free Trial Signups: 50K | Free-to-Paid: 7%
- Trial Drop-off Reasons: Setup complexity (40%), integrations (25%), unclear value (20%)

## 📚 Frameworks Used
- **RARRA (Retention-First Growth)** over AARRR or PLG
- **Impact vs Effort Matrix** for prioritization
- SaaS KPIs: LTV, CAC, Magic Number, Rule of 40

## 🔍 Insights
- Retention is the biggest leak: churn at 4.5% wipes out growth
- Trial experience is complex → only 45% complete onboarding
- High CPA ($350) + low conversion (7%) = inefficient acquisition spend
- Expansion revenue only 20% → under-leveraged

## 💡 Recommendations
1. Churn Prediction & Risk-based Retention Campaigns
2. Shorter, segmented Onboarding Tours
3. Value-based Pricing Repackaging
4. Focus on Mid-Market & Enterprise for LTV lift
5. Launch Referral & Loyalty Program to reduce CAC
