# 📘 SaaS Growth & Retention Analysis – Document360

## 🎯 Objective
To evaluate Document360's SaaS performance, with a focus on identifying bottlenecks in acquisition, activation, and retention, and propose data-backed strategies to improve revenue, customer lifetime value (LTV), and reduce churn.

## 📊 Key Focus Areas
- SaaS Metrics: LTV, CAC, Magic Number, Rule of 40
- Funnel Analysis: Website visitors → Trial → Paid
- Retention Analysis: Churn, NRR, GRR
- Strategic Frameworks: RARRA > AARRR
- Root Cause Diagnosis of Growth Bottlenecks

## 📈 Highlights
- Churn rate = 4.5% → unsustainable loss of revenue
- NRR < 100% → losing more from existing customers than gaining
- Trial-to-paid conversion = 12% → setup complexity a key blocker
- CPA = $350, but low monetization → inefficient acquisition spend

## 🧠 Recommendations
1. Targeted retention campaigns using churn-risk signals
2. Redesign onboarding to reduce complexity, add tooltips & segmentation
3. Feature bundling & value-based pricing
4. Focus on mid-market & enterprise segments for higher LTV
5. Launch referral + loyalty programs to lower CAC
